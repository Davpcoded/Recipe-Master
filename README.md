# User Story

As a user, I want to make meals with the food I have at home, so that I can save money, reduce waste, and eat healthy.

# Project Description

Recipe Master allows a user to enter ingredients they have at home into a "Pantry List".
Using these ingredients, the user will search for 4 recipe's at a time from Recipe Puppy API that
will be displayed in Bulma cards. Clicking on a recipe will both take you to the recipe URL and display
the ingredients of the recipe. Ingredients that the user has on the pantry list will be highlighted
green, while ingredients the user doesn't have will be highlighted red. Clicking on any ingredient will
bring up the nutrition info provided by the USDA Food Data API.
